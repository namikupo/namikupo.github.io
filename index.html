<h2><a href="/posts/post-1/">Super cool blog post title thingie thingie</a></h2>
<p><p>this is a super duper cool first post</p>
<p>So just to write it down:
Algorithm-based compression.
The idea is to take data, and compress it by generating an algorithm that generates the data.
As a basic example, for a program that consists of the bits &quot;11110000&quot; i'd want to generate an algorithm that generates the bits &quot;11110000&quot;.
I'm imagining that it's some sort of equation, which given a number generates a value between 0 and 1. By rounding either up or down it'll generate the numbers.
The expression would either have to generate a single bit/byte, repeating the operation until the data is generated.
A downside of doing it this way, is that it would require potentially many iterations of the algorithm to generate the data. Long time/much power.
This would mean that the compressed file contains no data, but the algorithm/expression to generate it.
I believe this has the potential to reduce files sizes.</p>
<p>x = d, where x is the algorithm and d is the data
d will be a series of values between 0 and 1.
x will be an expression that generates a series of values between 0 and 1</p>
<p>Ideal use would be something like:
Terminal: AlgoCompression compress data.type
Output: dataAlgorithm.AC</p>
<p>Terminal: AlgoCompression generate dataAlgorithm.AC
Output: data.type</p>
<p>could verify output via checksums</p>
